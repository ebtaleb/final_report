\noindent
In your thesis you should try to explain as much as possible with the help of images.
\\
\\
The abstract is the most important part of your thesis. Take your time to write it as good as possible. Abstract should have no more than one page. It is normal to rewrite the abstract again and again, so  probaly you won't write the final abstract before the last week of due-date. Before submitting your thesis you should give at least the abstract, the introduction and the conclusion to a native english speaker. It is likely that almost no one will read your thesis as a whole but most people will read the abstract, the introduction and the conclusion.
\\
\\
Start with some introductionary lines, followed by some words why your topic is relevant and why your solution is needed concluding with 'what I have done'. Don't use too many buzzwords. The abstract may also be read by people who are not familiar with your topic.
